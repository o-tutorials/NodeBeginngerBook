JavaScript and Node.js

JavaScript and You
----
Before we talk about all the technical stuff, let’s take a moment and talk about you and your relationship with JavaScript. This chapter is here to allow you to estimate if reading this document any further makes sense for you.

If you are like me, you started with HTML “development” long ago, by writing HTML documents. You came along this funny thing called JavaScript, but you only used it in a very basic way, adding interactivity to your web pages every now and then.

What you really wanted was “the real thing”, you wanted to know how to build complex web sites - you learned a programming language like PHP, Ruby, Java, and started writing “backend” code.

Nevertheless, you kept an eye on JavaScript, you saw that with the introduction of jQuery, Prototype and the likes, things got more advanced in JavaScript land, and that this language really was about more than window.open().

However, this was all still frontend stuff, and although it was nice to have jQuery at your disposal whenever you felt like spicing up a web page, at the end of the day you were, at best, a JavaScript user, but not a JavaScript developer.

And then came Node.js. JavaScript on the server, how cool is that?

You decided that it’s about time to check out the old, new JavaScript. But wait, writing Node.js applications is the one thing; understanding why they need to be written the way they are written means - understanding JavaScript. And this time for real.

Here is the problem: Because JavaScript really lives two, maybe even three lives (the funny little DHMTL helper from the mid-90’s, the more serious frontend stuff like jQuery and the likes, and now server-side), it’s not that easy to find information that helps you to learn JavaScript the “right” way, in order to write
Node.js applications in a fashion that makes you feel you are not just using JavaScript, you are actually developing it.

Because that’s the catch: you already are an experienced developer, you don’t want to learn a new technique by just hacking around and mis-using it; you want to be sure that you are approaching it from the right angle.

There is, of course, excellent documentation out there. But documentation alone sometimes isn’t enough. What is needed is guidance.

My goal is to provide a guide for you.
